### Project Title
- **Quality Prediction of Apples**
  
#### Short Description
This project aims to predict the quality of apples based on various features such as acidity, weight, color, etc., using machine learning algorithms.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

#### Installing
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/meetdikshagoyal/quality_prediction_apples.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

### Running the Tests
#### Breakdown of Tests
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical, and split the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**: Train logistic regression and random forest classifiers using grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using accuracy score and visualize confusion matrices.

### Deployment
This project can be deployed as a web application or integrated into existing systems for real-time quality prediction of apples in agricultural or retail settings.
